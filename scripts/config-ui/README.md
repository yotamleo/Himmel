# config-ui

`himmelctl ui` serves the config console on `127.0.0.1` (Bun, loopback only,
per-launch token). Operator-only: it refuses to start inside a Claude session
(HIMMEL-4350).

## Tests

- Unit and server suites: `bun test scripts/config-ui --dots` (CI-gated).
- Browser e2e (HIMMEL-4400): `scripts/config-ui/tests/e2e/`, Playwright pinned
  to 1.63.0 (Chromium build 1243). **Opt-in, not in CI**: a runner has no
  cached Chromium, and fetching one on every PR would make a download outage
  red-flake the fleet. Run it where `~/.cache/ms-playwright` already holds
  build 1243:

  ```bash
  cd scripts/config-ui/tests/e2e
  bun install
  bunx playwright test
  ```

  Each test boots its own real `himmelctl ui --port 0` against a fixture feed
  (stub via `CONFIG_UI_HIMMELCTL`; the live station feed never runs). The
  bundle order comes from `scripts/himmelctl/lib/feed-bundles.json`.
  `E2E_BREAK=order` feeds a mis-ordered bundle list: the suite must go red.

## Manual pass (the same 7 items)

From your own terminal (not inside Claude):

```bash
node scripts/himmelctl/bin.js ui --port 0
```

Open the printed URL, `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/#t=<64 hex>` (the token rides
the fragment). The first report can take a couple of minutes.

- [ ] 1. Controls and Inventory render as bundles in table order (Search & graph … Install & toolchain).
- [ ] 2. A bundle with no fail or warn row is collapsed; one with a fail or warn row opens by default.
- [ ] 3. Each header shows its headline health plus only the non-zero counts (Bypass flags reads `48 off`).
- [ ] 4. "Show only problems" hides healthy rows; header counts read `n of N`.
- [ ] 5. Searching `C45` opens Search & graph with the hit row; clearing restores the default state.
- [ ] 6. Tab to a header; Enter or Space toggles it; focus stays on that header after the repaint.
- [ ] 7. Unsorted is absent with 0 unmapped rows; when one exists it is always open and last.
- [ ] Header: above the page, one line shows `himmel <version> · <describe>`, the 12-char commit, the served checkout and the feed time; a feed without `himmel` reads `version unknown (feed has no himmel identity)`.
- [ ] Page links: the rail lists the pages (Config only for now), the current one is highlighted, and the address bar reads `#/config` (the token never stays in the URL).
- [ ] Safety: click a toggle: only a dry-run plan appears; confirm stays disabled until you type the target; cancel clears it.
